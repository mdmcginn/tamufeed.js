# Dependencies

1. [Require.js](http://requirejs.org/) asynchronous JavaScript loader
2. [Google Feed API](https://developers.google.com/feed/) will continue w/o incompatible changes until 4/20 in 2015
3. [jQuery](http://jquery.com/) or [zepto.js](http://zeptoJS.com/)
4. Optional: [Normalize.css](http://necolas.github.com/normalize.css/) is the new reset.css
5. Optional: [Underscore.js](http://underscorejs.org/) utility-belt library

If you want to retrieve more than ten entries per feed, 
[obtain a Google API key](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/tutorial#api_key)
and pass it as the `key=` URL parameter when you load the `www.google.com/jsapi` script.

# How it works

tamufeed.js works by initializing service connection,
when the document object model is ready.
Then it pulls feeds, models data, sorts entries &
puts a view into the stage element on the page.

# Feed Types

We retrieve news feeds from Google, recognizing
[microformats](http://microformats.org/)
in a feed entry's `content` if found e.g. 
[hCalendar](http://microformats.org/wiki/hcalendar),
[hCard](http://microformats.org/wiki/hcard).

# Configuration

These parameters are set in the `tamufeed` object.

* `url` feed address
* `selector` the CSS selector that locates your stage element uniquely
* `sort` sorts entries
    * `"forward"` sorts events ascending and non-events descending
    * `"reverse"` sorts events descending and non-events ascending time
* `fetchEntries` number of entries to fetch from the service provider for each feed. For calendar feeds, this should be high enough to still have enough events to display after the historical events are set to `display:none`.
* `wantEntries` number of entries you want to show. After this number of entries is exceeded (not counting any historical events), the CSS class `over` is put onto subsequent entries, enabling CSS to `display:none` them.
* `truncatedStringMaxLength` sets number of characters (default 300)
* `minutesBeforeHistorical` sets slack once dtstart has elapsed before event is labelled historical (default 30)
* `debugging` turns on the F12 console debug messages

# Use Asynchronous Script Loading

Async JS loading reduces page load time, because it lets scripts load 
in parallel (instead of serially); this boosts web performance.
[Here's](http://css-tricks.com/thinking-async/)
[why](http://requirejs.org/docs/why.html) async *is* best practice
(c.f.
[@souders](http://twitter.com/souders),
[video](http://radar.oreilly.com/2012/04/velocity-podcast-series-p1.html),
[blog](http://www.stevesouders.com/blog/2010/05/07/wpo-web-performance-optimization/)).
If you're unfamiliar with asynchronous loaders, you should 
[read](http://requirejs.org/) the basics of using `require.js`/

The `async.html` source is intuitive and easy to follow (once you understand
using an asynchronous script loader).

# Markup

One thing you must add to your HTML somewhere is the stage element where you
want tamufeed to insert its output into, e.g. `<div id="tamufeed"></div>`.

# Templates

This program allows you to customize the HTML output via templates that you
control in your markup. The variables, where the script injects its content,
are always delimited by mustache/handlebar characters like `{{this}}`.

* `feedTemplate` governs what feeds will be marked up with
* `entryTemplate` controls the display of entries (of all types)
* `dateTemplate` formats how the date part of `{{time}}` should look
* `propertyTemplate` is how individual properties will be marked up
* `encasedTemplate` is used to encase any HTML value that could possibly be malformed
* `calendardayTemplate` decides how the `{{calendarday}}` come out

## Date Templates Variables

The single-letter variables used with dates is an incomplete subset of
[here](http://www.php.net/manual/en/function.date.php). If you encounter one
that you would like to use that isn't yet implemented, 
[create an issue](/montyaggie/tamufeed.js/issues/new) requesting it be added
and we'll fix that for you.

# Style

You'll want to write some CSS styles to govern the appearance of your
feed on your page. Feel free to copy liberally from the styles.css, if they
help you.  Firebug or Safari or Chrome's F12 developer tools are quite helpful,
for introspecting the HTML and trying out styles that you can then put into
your own CSS.
